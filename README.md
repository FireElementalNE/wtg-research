# Android Window Transition Graphs

This program is attempting to create Android Window trasition graphs for  
the static analyzer [DroidInfer](https://github.com/proganalysis/type-inference).

# Running
Coming soon!

# Requirements
* Java JDK (you need javac)
* All of the classes that will be analyzed (anything not explicitly given  
  will be treated as a phantom-ref!) Most of the classes needed are in  
  [classpath_includes](https://github.com/FireElementalNE/wtg-research/tree/master/classpath_includes.tgz)
   and in [android-17/android.jar](https://github.com/FireElementalNE/wtg-research/blob/master/android-17/android.jar)

# Notes
* The original WTG paper can be found [here](http://dacongy.github.io/papers/yang-ase15.pdf).
