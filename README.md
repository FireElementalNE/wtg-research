# Android Window Transition Graphs

This program is attempting to create Android Window trasition graphs for  
the static analyzer [DroidInfer](https://github.com/proganalysis/type-inference).

# Running
Coming soon!

# Requirements
* Java JDK (you need javac)
* All of the classes that will be analyzed (anything not explicitly given  
  will be treated as a phantom-ref!)  

# Notes
* The original WTG paper can be found [here](http://dacongy.github.io/papers/yang-ase15.pdf).
